# RC2

The name has two meanings: First, it's a command and control (C2) program for [R]obots; it's also a
rewrite of an earlier project in Clojure (Robot Controller #2).

## Usage

This project is currently (June 2014) in an intermediate phase - I'm rewriting it to have a
web-based UI which lets you control the robot interactively. You can use some of the functionality
from the REPL, and earlier revisions would let you specify a script to run.
