;; This protocol defines pose creation functions. Passing a desired position and
;; descriptor allows the functions to create pose descriptions that can be
;; passed to robot drivers.

;; This protocol is intended to be used by functions which implement interfaces
;; to the actual device. These could be hardware or software interfaces; when
;; you give the function a pose the robot should change state to move to it.
