    ;; Compute distances between each destination and each source. Sort the points by these
    ;; distances, and select the lowest weighted path. Add the path to the path list. Select the next
    ;; lowest path - if it's from a destination that's already in the path list, skip it. If not, add
    ;; it to the path list. Repeat untill all destinations have been accounted for.
